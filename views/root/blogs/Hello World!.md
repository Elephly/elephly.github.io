# First entry!

Hi! My name is Nick and this is the first entry into my personal website's blog.
The significance of this event is not so much the birth of the blog itself, but
the accomplishment of developing the blog system. I had the idea to make use of
Github Pages to make a very simple blog system in which updates could be made by
simply pushing new markdown files to the repository. I saw this as a nice little
challenge considering Github Pages doesn't support hosting real web apps, but
only static HTML pages. Thus, my hacking was very experimental and purely a
learning experience. Nevertheless, from the experience also came a little place
I could call my own on the internet -- a place into which I could post whatever
I felt like. So here is to a future of untold adventures.

Cheers!
