  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Nick and I'm a Canadian computer science graduate and
    hobbyist video game developer. I enjoy all sorts of software development,
    but tend to use a lot of my spare time creating rather useless programs. I
    am virtually always working on something and keep a long backlog of future
    projects to work on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for other hobbies, I enjoy physical activity and sports, video games (my
    current favourites are Overwatch and Diddy Kong Racing), food eating, and
    relaxing on a nice warm day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for stopping by!
