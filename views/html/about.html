  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Nick and I'm a Canadian computer science graduate and
    hobbyist video game developer. While I am most driven to make games in my
    spare time, I enjoy all sorts of software development. I am virtually always
    working on something and keep a long backlog of future projects to work on.
